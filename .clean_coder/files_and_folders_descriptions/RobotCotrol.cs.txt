File responsible for robot arm simulation and control in Unity, focusing on autonomous targeting and data recording.

Key integration points:
- Controls robot arm joints using auto-aim calculations
- Captures camera images during simulation
- Records episode data (actions, states, images) to JSON
- Automatically shoots projectiles towards a target

The script manages a robotic shooting system, generating actions, capturing sensor data, and logging episode information for potential machine learning or analysis purposes.

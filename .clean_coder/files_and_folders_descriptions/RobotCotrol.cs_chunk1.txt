The `RobotControl` class is a Unity MonoBehaviour that manages a robotic arm simulation for shooting targets. It handles robot joint transformations, camera tracking, projectile shooting, and data collection for each simulation episode. The class prepares core components like joint transforms, camera, barrel, target, and sets up data recording infrastructure with configurable image dimensions and movement parameters.

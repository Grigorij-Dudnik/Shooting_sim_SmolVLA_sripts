The Update() method manages the robot arm's continuous movement by calculating auto-aim actions, executing a simulation step, and recording data. DoSimulationStep() is responsible for applying joint rotations based on an input action vector, transforming robot joint positions according to predefined rotation speeds and directions. This function enables frame-by-frame robot movement control and state tracking during the simulation.

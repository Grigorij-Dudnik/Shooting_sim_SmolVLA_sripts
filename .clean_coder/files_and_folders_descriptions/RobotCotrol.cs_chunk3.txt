This code chunk is responsible for rotating robot joints smoothly and calculating their state based on frame-independent rotation. It multiplies rotation speed by delta time to ensure consistent movement across different frame rates, rotates joints accordingly, and normalizes their state values between -1 and 1. The function also captures a camera image and returns the joint states, image data, and a boolean indicating episode success.

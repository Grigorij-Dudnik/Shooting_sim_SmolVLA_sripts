The `GetCameraImage()` function captures a screenshot from the specified camera (PistolCam) and converts it into a byte array representation (JPEG). It creates a temporary render texture, renders the camera view into it, reads the pixels, and converts the image to a compressed JPEG format. The function returns the image data along with its width and height, enabling image recording for the robot simulation's data logging process.

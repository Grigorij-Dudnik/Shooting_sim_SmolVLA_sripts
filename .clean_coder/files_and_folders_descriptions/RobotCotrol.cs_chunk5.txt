This code chunk is responsible for converting a Unity screenshot to a JPG byte array and cleaning up temporary resources. It encodes a screenshot texture to a compressed JPEG with a quality of 80, destroys temporary objects, and returns the image data along with its dimensions. The subsequent function begins calculating auto-aim actions by determining the normalized direction from the barrel to the target.

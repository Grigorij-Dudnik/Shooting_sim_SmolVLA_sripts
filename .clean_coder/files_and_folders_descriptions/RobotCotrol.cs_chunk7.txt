The `Shoot()` method is responsible for spawning a projectile from the robot arm's barrel with a predefined speed. It creates a new projectile at the barrel's position, sets its velocity in the forward direction of the barrel, and automatically destroys the projectile after 0.5 seconds. This function enables the simulated robot arm to fire projectiles in the Unity environment, providing a basic shooting mechanism for the robotic system.

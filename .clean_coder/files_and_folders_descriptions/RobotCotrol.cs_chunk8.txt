The function RecordLeRobotData is responsible for capturing and storing simulation data during each episode. It creates a DataEntry object that includes timestamp, action vector, robot state, and camera image data. When an episode is complete, it saves the collected data to a JSON file with a timestamped filename, allowing for logging and later analysis of robot arm simulation data.

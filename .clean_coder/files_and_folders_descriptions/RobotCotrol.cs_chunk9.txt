This code snippet handles saving robot simulation episode data to a JSON file. It combines the application's persistent data path with a timestamped filename, converts the episode data to a serializable JSON format using a generic wrapper class, and writes the JSON to a file. The SerializableList<T> class enables Unity's JsonUtility to serialize lists of custom objects, which would otherwise be problematic. The function logs the path of the saved episode file for verification.
